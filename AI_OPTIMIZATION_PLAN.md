## Phase 2: AI-Driven Features (Next)

### Predictive Carbon Modeling
```python
# Smart carbon prediction based on model architecture
carbon_predictor = CarbonPredictor(
    model_architecture=model.config,
    training_setup=training_args,
    historical_data="carbon_history.db"
)

predicted_footprint = carbon_predictor.estimate(
    epochs=10,
    batch_size=32,
    sequence_length=512
)
```

### Adaptive Training Schedules
```python
# Schedule training for lowest carbon impact
scheduler = SmartCarbonScheduler(
    region="europe-west1",
    flexibility_hours=24,
    carbon_budget_kg=5.0
)

optimal_window = scheduler.find_greenest_time()
# Train at 03:00 UTC for 45% carbon reduction
```

### Real-time Optimization Recommendations
```python
# Live suggestions during training
optimizer = CarbonOptimizer()
recommendations = optimizer.get_live_suggestions(
    current_metrics=trainer.carbon_metrics,
    remaining_steps=trainer.remaining_steps
)
# "Switch to mixed precision for 30% energy reduction"
```
